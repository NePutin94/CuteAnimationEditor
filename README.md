# *Cute Animation Editor*
- ### How can I use it?
	- ##### Hotkeys
		>**C** - moving part of the animation by pixels
		>**X** - moving part of the animation by global coordinates
		>**Space** - camera movement, first set the flag "use mouse to move" in the tab [Window Settings](#window-settings)
		>**Mouse wheel** - zooming the camera
	 - ##### Editor
		1. *Creator Mode* - in this mode, you can see all the editing elements
		
		2. *TAP window* - in this window you can see what the animation looks like
			- Left Part
			All created animation groups can be found here and you can select a group to view from them
			- Right Part
			There is a window for viewing the animation and tabs for changing some animation parameters

		3. *Animation Groups* - here you can divide animations into groups by their type and purpose(walk, run, idle, etc.)
	- ##### Load Asset
		Just enter the file name (template: *.json), the asset will be loaded and will be available in the [Loaded Assets](#loaded-assets) tab
	- ##### Create Asset
		`Does not work`
	- ##### Window Settings

	- ##### Loaded Assets
		Here you can set the current asset, *until you do this, the editor will not work*
